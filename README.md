# Pedram's Dotfiles

I got tired of big packages like oh-my-zsh and tons of VIM plugins I didn't understand,
so I decided it's time to lovingly handcraft my dotfiles.

I use [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot/tree/5d83f9e797b1950199e127a8196803f5e33e0916#full-example) to keep my dotfiles up to date. 
Clean, simple, and easy.

My VIM configs are Neovim-specific only. They may or may not work with plain-ol'-vim.

Use everything at your own risk, and feel free to reach out with any questions.
