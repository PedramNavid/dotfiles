# Pedram's Dotfiles

I got tired of big packages like oh-my-zsh and tons of VIM plugins I didn't understand,
so I decided it's time to lovingly handcraft my dotfiles.

I use GNU stow to manually install my dotfiles. Clean, simple, and easy.

```sh
stow git
```

My VIM configs are Neovim-specific only. They may or may not work with plain-ol'-vim.

Use everything at your own risk, and feel free to reach out with any questions.
