## Stylistic rules

Avoid unnecessary comments, for example, do not do this:

```typescript
// This checks if the user is an admin
if (path.startsWith('/admin') || path.startsWith('/api/admin')) {
          return token?.role === 'admin'
        }
```

Only add comments to sections that are not self-evident, or that help with
identifying the structure of a large piece of code.
