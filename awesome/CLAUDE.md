## AwesomeWM Config

This is a repo for the AwesomeWM config. It is based of awesomewm-git, not the 4.3 release.

You can find the documentation for the git-release here: https://awesomewm.org/apidoc/documentation/07-my-first-awesome.md.html

The configuration is all in `rc.lua`

You can test your changes with aawmtt

```bash
aawmtt
```

This will spawn a new awesome window using Xephyr, with the logs to stdout.

There's a minimal theme in `./pedburn`
