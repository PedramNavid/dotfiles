Collection of things I notice while working that could be addressed..


## DBT-related

- Highlight line-errors in Terminal when running DBT
- Visual select word and wrap with sql function and as ...
	e.g. column -> max(column) as column
- DBT RUN should recycle a window if possible. Maybe popup window?
  or be used as a compiler? look up :help quickfix.txt and errorformat
